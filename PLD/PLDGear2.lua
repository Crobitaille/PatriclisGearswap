-- TODO: Determine which is more effective, laying out each set explicitly, or using sets_combine
-- Note: My issue with set_combine is that it requires doing calculations and combinations during a cast
-- If the system is being slow (or your casts are particularly fast) this could result in not equipping the correct equipment 
-- Fast enough. I think this is a fringe issue that doesn't happen very often, but I have seen it occur once or twice.
-- set_combine does save on memory as you can keep smaller objects in memory and combine them as needed, but I am concerned about it's 
-- effect on speed.
-- RAM is cheap and plentiful... Time is finite since we only have a limited window to equip gear.
